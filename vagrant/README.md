vagrant files and machines

* Use vagrant file

* Must switch machine to default use gnome before running sikuli scripts

* A working machine can be found at 
    * https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qm0bq6909po6uhh/AAAKRhciXSiWRww_WCIq7TZea?dl=0
    * Download all files into a folder. 
    * Assuming you have Vagrant installed along with Virtualbox 4.3.30, do.cmd should work
